# Contributing

Contributions to the SNU 2D Erotica are allowed, as long as you follow these contributing guidelines:

> * Keep it professional for the environment

> This is a website module. Please be careful what you words you use. Even though this area is NSFW, some things like racial slurs are not tolerated.

> * Know the difference between erotica and pornography

Erotica doesn't involve intercourse, pornography does. If you now think you are in the wrong place, switch over to [here.](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU_2D_Porn/)

> * Do not modify snapshot files

> Snapshot files serve as an archive of old versions of pages. Do not edit or delete these files

> * Create snapshot files after each verified commit

> You have to create archives of your work after each commit to a file. For snapshots, just copy and paste the file you edited with the contents you edited, and save it in the `OldVersions/` directory with the original name, followed by `_snapshot` then a number that is 1 above the previous snapshot

> * Do not modify certain files

> Only approved high-level contributers can modify certain files, such as Wiki pages, contributing.md, README.md, and the license.

> * Do not add in tracking scripts

> Trackers are not allowed in any of my projects. Please keep backdoors, trackers, rootkits, keyloggers, and other privacy invasive features out of every file,

> * Keep it efficient

> These pages should be able to quickly load with less than 10 megabits of bandwidth speed. Please do not bog down page performance.

> * Don't add images without permission

> Images are sensitive for this project and will need to be approved before they can be committed.

> * Don't upload sexual images

> This is the module for the site for people to upload the files. You shouldn't upload them yourself, once the distribution is compiled and online, you can upload like a normal user. Don't upload content to the module itself.

Please make sure to follow these rules to develop here.
